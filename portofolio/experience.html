        <h5>UI/UX designer <span>& Frontend Dev</span></h5>
        <p>I have experience in UI/UX and Frontend Dev. In the UI/UX field, I once designed an attendance system that I made in Figma. This project was a requirement to get a Final Semester Test score in the Human and Computer Interaction course when I was in semester 2</p>
        <p>In the field of Frontend Dev, I have created agricultural themed website pages and created a personal website. This assignment was the first assignment for the Web Programming 1 course when I was in semester 3. Even though I still had little knowledge, I did all my best to complete the project. I continue to dig into this field because I am increasingly interested and want to know more about this field</p>
